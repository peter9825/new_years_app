New Year Resolutions Application 


Project Overview:

- JavaFX application that allows users to manage and track their New Year's resolutions.
  The app demonstrates a simple Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern where the data model maintains the state of resolutions,
  and two views let users confirm resolutions and review a history of their actions.

Features:

- Manage Resolutions:
  The main window displays a predefined list of resolutions. Users can confirm a resolution or undo a confirmation.

- History Log:
  Each action (confirmation or undo) is recorded in a history log displayed in a separate window.

- MVC Pattern:
  The application separates the concerns of data (in NyrData), presentation (JavaFX views), and user interactions (controllers).


 Requirements:
 
 - Java Development Kit (JDK): Version 8 or later.
 - JavaFX (JavaFX is included in JDK 8. For later versions, you might need to install the JavaFX SDK separately)
 - IDE (intellij, eclipse) or a text editor (VSCode) to run the project.


 Running the Application:
 - Clone or Import the Project into your preferred environment.
 - Have all dependencies (e.g., JavaFX libraries) correctly configured.
 - Execute the MainApp class to launch the application.
